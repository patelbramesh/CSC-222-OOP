Description:
This program reads student data from a file where the first line indicates
the number of students and number of test scores. Each following line contains
a student's name, ID, and test scores. The program dynamically allocates an
array of structs to store the student data, calculates each studentâ€™s average
test score and letter grade, prints a formatted report, and properly releases
all allocated memory before it ends.
